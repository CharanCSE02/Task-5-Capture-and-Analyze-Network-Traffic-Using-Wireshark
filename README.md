Cyber security

# Wireshark

Wireshark is a tool used for network traffic monitoring.It capture the network traffic using with protocol,destination ip address,source ip address and port numbers.

This wireshark is called networking tool.This network traffic we will seen in encryption mode only.

Example : I used this tool to monitor my wi-if traffic with wireshark.

In this task used protocols to monitor the traffic.

They are : DNS - Domain Name Service Protocol

HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

TCP - Transmission Control Protocol

UDP - User Datagram Protocol

# DNS

The DNS is domain name service it means when enter a website name(like youtude) the server(or)system can not understand text,So it convert number.

It means every domain(or)website have some ip address.

example : Google is 8.8.8.8

# HTTP

The HTTP is used for HTTP communication is based on requests and responses. A client sends an HTTP request to the server, which processes the request and returns an HTTP response. This interaction is stateless, meaning the server does not retain any session data between requests. However, cookies can be used to add state to some client-server interactions.

It means user interaction to server.

example : http://example.com

# TCP

The TCP is used for transport protocol.The data is transfer using this protocol.

Every data will transfer in UDP and TCP protocol only.The data will transfer any protocol between o to 65535 numbers.

example : http and https
